Notes for tremulator project:

8/6:
	Camera up and running connected to USB micro port.
	Wifi working but intermittently cutting out. Eth is dependable.
	OpenCV script is having issues tracking tennis ball, but is able to track smaller ball.
	Need to solder new accelerometer headers and experiment.

8/9:
	BNO055 accelerometer detected on i2c bus 1 with command: sudo i2cdetect -y -r 1
	Address is 0x28

	sudo i2cget 1 40 0 :: returned 0xa0
	sudo i2cget 1 40 1 :: returned 0xfb

8/23:
    # Set the mode to NDOF mode before we can read actual data.
    sudo i2cset 1 0x28 0x3D 0x1C

    # Check calibration register. All 1's means everything is calibrated.
    sudo i2cget 1 0x28 0x35

    # Check/set full scale range


9/7:

   To compile: Need c++ standard 11 to use to_string function.
    g++ -std=c++0x i2c_test.cpp
